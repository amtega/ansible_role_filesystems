# Role default lower priority variables

# List of dicts with filesystems to setup. The dicts have the same attributes
# that the ones expected by the ansible filesystem module. Example:
#
# filesystems:
#   - dev: /dev/sdb1
#     force: no
#     fstype: xfs
#     opts: []
#     resizefs: no

filesystems: []

# Dicitionary with the defaults options to use if no other ones are specified in
# the `filesystems` variable. The members of the dict are the same attributes
# that the ones expected by the ansible parted module

filesystems_defaults:
  fstype: xfs
  force: no

# Indicate `filesystems` must be loaded also from host variables. Any host
# variable that begins with "filesystems_*" and contains the necessary
# attributes will be loaded as an item to manage by the role. The variables must
#  follow the structure detailed before for `filesystems`

filesystems_load_from_hostvars: no
